== Version 1.1 ==

Fixed blogger content processor to ignore tracking pixels. 

As of May 20th, 2009, I noticed that blogger had started adding these malformed tracking pixels into blog posts:
{{{
<div class="blogger-post-footer">
   <img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1492888914988931727-4681360279888199619?l=blogname.blogspot.com' />
</div>
}}}

This was messing up the image downloader. This fix adds some smarts to the blogger content processor to ignore tracking pixels as follows:
  # not downloading tracking pixels as part of image downloading
  # Deactivating all tracking pixels by re-writing their img tags to have src="" width="0" height="0". All deactivated img tags have a comment attribute with comment="original tracking pixel deactivated by jblogbackup" and the original src is stored in the attribute src-orig.

== Version 1.0 ==

Initial release.
