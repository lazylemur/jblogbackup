{"name":"Jblogbackup","tagline":"Create a standalone backup zip file of your Blogger blog including posts, comments and images","body":"## Overview ##\r\n\r\njblogbackup is a Java command line tool which allows you to backup your [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) blog content including the following:\r\n  * posts\r\n  * comments\r\n  * images (including the larger click-through images)\r\n\r\nBlog content is downloaded and processed into one directory which contains the following:\r\n  * index.html : all blog posts and comments in one HTML file\r\n  * styles.css : CSS style sheet\r\n  * images/ directory : contains all downloaded images using the same file name as [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). The larger \"click-through\" images are suffixed with `_fullsize`.\r\n  * log.html : a processing log of warnings and errors\r\n  * atom/ directory : contains the atom posts (entries.xml) and comments (comments.xml)\r\n\r\nTo see what a jblogbackup backup looks like check out\r\n  * the jblogbackup [Test Blog](http://jblogbackup-test.blogspot.com) and\r\n  * its corresponding [Backup](http://www.mycreativecup.com/jblogbackup-test)\r\n\r\n## Feature Highlights ##\r\n\r\n  * Downloads all [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) images including the larger \"click-through\" images\r\n  * Only uses the [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) public API so no authentication required\r\n  * A zip file of the backup directory can be created by setting `jblogbackup.createZipFile=true` or using the command line option `--zip <zipfile>`\r\n  * Image downloading is parallelized\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n\r\n  * Java 6 JRE or JDK\r\n\r\n## How to Install and Run a Backup ##\r\n\r\n  1. Be sure to have Java 6 installed. We assume its installed in directory `{JAVA_HOME}`\r\n  1. Download jblogbackup-onejar-{version}.jar to directory `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}`\r\n  1. Figure out the name of the [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) blog you want to backup. The name can be found in the blog's URL as follows: `http://{blog-name}.blogspot.com`\r\n  1. From your OS command line\r\n    * `cd {JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}`\r\n    * `{JAVA_HOME}/java -jar jblogbackup-onejar-{version}.jar --blogname {blog-name}`\r\n  1. This will create the blog backup in directory `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}/{blog-name}`\r\n\r\nAdditional Parameters:\r\n  * To create a zip file at `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}/{blog-name}/{blog-name}.zip` add the `--zip` command line switch\r\n  * If you run this backup periodically you can add the `--clean` switch to delete all files in the `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}/{blog-name}` directory when the backup starts.\r\n  * Add `--appendtimestamp` to append a timestamp to your backup directory e.g. `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}/{blog-name}_ddMMMyy-HHmmss`\r\n  * To specify default settings, create a Java properties file at `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}/jblogbackup.properties` with one property per line e.g. `jblogbackup.{paramname}={paramvalue}`. That way you won't have to specify all your desired parameters via the command line when running the command above from the `{JBLOGBACKUP_HOME}` directory. For example:\r\n```\r\njblogbackup.appendTimestampToBackupDir = true\r\njblogbackup.cleanBackupDir = true\r\njblogbackup.createZipFile = true \r\n```\r\n  * Use the `--printconfig` command line switch to print out your current configuration WITHOUT running the backup. This is useful if you are using a combination of command line switches and jblogbackup.properties files:\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar jblogbackup-onejar-1.0.jar --blogname buzz --backupdir /tmp --printconfig \r\nPARAMETERS\r\nBlog Name: buzz\r\nBackup Directory Path: /tmp\r\nAppend Timestamp To Backup Dir: false\r\nClean Backup Dir: false\r\nCreate Zip File: false\r\nZip File Path: //tmp.zip\r\nNumber of Image Download Threads: 4\r\nForce GC to Limit Open Files: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Command Line Interface ##\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: jblogbackup.CmdLineTool\r\n -?

Only needed if you see java.io.FileNotFoundException due to \"Too many open files\". This may be needed on some hosted servers where the maximum number of open files (`ulimit -n`) has low limit e.g. 100.  |\r\n\r\n## Known Limitations ##\r\n\r\n  * There is no attempt to backup the look and feel of the blog.\r\n  * The blog is saved as one large HTML file index.html\r\n  * Blog atom posts are downloaded all at once i.e. no support for paginating through posts. This may or may not be needed to support very large blogs.\r\n  * Currently no support for incremental backups.\r\n  * Only supports [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). Note that the code is mostly generic and not too much work would be needed to support other blogging software (like WordPress). To support other blogging software, one has to implement:\r\n    * a new factory for downloading the Atom or RSS and converting that into java objects (those java objects are used by Velocity when generating index.html and log.html)\r\n    * custom content handlers for things like click through images etc\r\n  * Blogger videos are NOT downloaded. The backed up entry will contain the original Blogger video object markup with a reference back to Blogger. This really needs to be fixed as jblogbackup should download all of one's content!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
